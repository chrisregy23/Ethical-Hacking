# Ethical Hacking: A Comprehensive Bootcamp

This project provides a detailed exploration of ethical hacking, focusing on the tools, techniques, and methodologies used to secure digital systems. Through hands-on exercises, learners will set up a virtual hacking lab using Kali Linux, explore cryptographic concepts like hash algorithms, and implement full disk encryption to protect sensitive data. The project also emphasizes the importance of the Security Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) in cybersecurity. By the end of this bootcamp, participants will have a solid foundation in ethical hacking, enabling them to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios.
